This module fetches sales taxes on sale orders and invoices for transactions
within the USA using the TaxJar API. You will need to have a (paid) account
with TaxJar to use this module. It allows you to calculate the correct tax
amounts based on the origin and the destination locations of the transactions,
as well as (optionally) commiting transactions to TaxJar so that they can
take care of your tax filings.
