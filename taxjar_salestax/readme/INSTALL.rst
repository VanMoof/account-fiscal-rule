This module depends on another Odoo module from the OCA, 'queue_job' from
https://github.com/oca/queue.

This module requires that the 'taxjar' Python library
(https://pypi.org/project/taxjar) is made available in the
Python environment in which you run Odoo.

In order to run the automated tests, you need to install the 'responses'
Python library (https://pypi.org/project/responses).
